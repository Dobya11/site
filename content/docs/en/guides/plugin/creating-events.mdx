## Event Class

You can import a Event class and create a function with the Event as a argument. [Click here](../../server/events) to look at all available events.

Example plugin when a player is ready (joins a server):
```java

public class ExampleEvent {

    public static void onPlayerReady(PlayerReadyEvent event) {
        Player player = event.getPlayer();
        player.sendMessage(Message.raw("Welcome " + player.getDisplayName()));
    }

}
```

## Registering the Event

You need to register all events you make in the Main plugin class, usually in the `setup` function.

```java
public class MyPlugin extends JavaPlugin {

    @Override
    public void setup() {
        this.getEventRegistry().registerGlobal(PlayerReadyEvent.class, ExampleEvent::onPlayerReady);
    }
}
```
